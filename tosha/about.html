   <h2> MY STORY</h2>
   
   
   
   
   
   
  <p> HI there! I 'm TOsha!I'm an adovate for you and your kids, and your personal partner in parenting. Let me tell you how i got here.</p>

<p>When I was five my parents divoreced, the house I loved was sold, my mom and i moved far, far away from all my friends , and i was a very angry girl. i "Hated" my dad, was furious at my mom, changed my name and spent most of first grade in the principal's office.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I had a mom who never lost sight of my goodnes. Not when I kicked and screamed. Not when i got in trouble at school. Instead, she remained my advocate. She ketp herself in good emotional shape so she could continue to listen to me rage without taking it personally or losing her cool. She was my rock.</p>

<p>Now I'm the mom. I have a husband and there boys of my own with their own challenges. I love being a mom! Becoming a parent is, hands down, the best decision I ever made. But parenting my boys hasn't always been easy. It sometimes feels harder than climbing a mountain in a snowstorm with an ice axe, and building a snow cave to protect my self for the night! (which I've done)</p>
<p  class="colBrown">PARENTING IS DIFFCULT BECAUSE, TO DO IT WELL, YOU MUST LOOK INSIDE YOURSELF. YOU NEED TO KNWO WHAT MAKES YOU SOAR, AND WHAT REALLY PUSHES YOUR BUTTONS. AND LOOKING AT ONESELF - REALLY LOOKING INSIDE - IS A CHALLANGE. THE THING IS, THE CONSEQUENCES OF NOT LOOKING ARE EVEN WORSE.</p>

<p>By the time my second son was born, I started catching my self saying things to my boys that left my feeling badly. I was reacting to everyday challenges more harshly than i wanted to. I know i needed help, but i didn't want therapy. I wanted to learn how to change my behaviours. I wanted to kwnow what I could do when my 2 year old went back to nursing every two hours at night and i had to get up for work in the </p>
   
   
   
   
   
   

<p>I developed a program that combines what I’ve learned through my ongoing education in parenting and brain science, including the Parenting by Connection tools, mindfulness, and strategic use of play. I add to that my special gift of Listening well, without judgment, and supporting you, as parents, wherever you are emotionally. I will help you see your son’s core goodness, so that you can help him stop his unworkable behaviors. Let’s do it! (Can “Let’s do it! be a link to opt-in?)</p>

<p>Tosha Schore is a certified teacher and trainer of instructors in Parenting by Connection. She also holds a BA in Women’s Studies & Language Studies from UCSC, and an MA in Applied Linguistics and a Certificate in TESOL from UCLA. Her training and years of experience as an adult educator, her studies in memory and neurobiology, her 12 years in the trenches with her husband and three boys, and the thousands of hours she has invested in supporting parents around the world all combine to help families thrive.</p>
