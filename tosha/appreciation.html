          <p>I contacted Tosha when my toddler began experiencing sleeping challenges.  Tosha asked me a couple of questions and then immediately was able to give me simple tips that I could employ the next night, explained the big ideas behind these actions, comforted me and validated my feelings and experiences in this challenging situation and also suggested some longer term supports for my daughter, my partner and me, all in a 30 minute call.   Within about three days we were back on track. A year later the longer term approach and techniques still ring true and I understand and can support my daughter so much better.  I also appreciated learning from her that our family’s experience is normal and can be addressed.  Tosha’s support and reassurance, combined with her thoughtful, proven methodologies got my family back to sleep and improved our interactions overall. <small>&nbsp;</small> </p>

          <p>I highly recommend working with Tosha and the Parenting by Connection tools. Not only can this radically help your child's day to day behavior, but the confidence these tools offer you as a parent are priceless. It is invaluable to know, when you are in the trenches with your children, that not only do you have tools to turn to, but that these tools are ultimately the best thing you can offer your child. Its not about simply managing the moment. Its about how to help your child heal, function better, and feel closer to you. There are lots of ways to parent, but none make me feel better about how I'm raising my children than the tools Tosha can offer. The peace this brings, in the midst of what seems to be chaos, is invaluable.  <small>&nbsp;</small> </p>
